        <p>I was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to New York to live with my mom. I spent most of my middle school and high school in NY.Moving forward, now that I'm in college I see myself working at a big magazine such as Vouge, Bazaar. As a photo editor or a designer creating beautiful images to display in the magazine. Also, I think of myself as a colorful person who likes to be in a good mmod. I love designing or creating things with color because It gives a good feeling.</p>
