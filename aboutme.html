        <p>I was born in the Dominican Republic. </p>
        <p>I see myself working at a big magazine such as Vouge, Bazaar as a photo editor or a designer creating beautiful images to display in the magazine. Also, I think of myself as a colorful person whose always in a good mood. I love designing or creating things with color because It gives a good feeling. Digital Design can be found anywhere at anytime. </p>
