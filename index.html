        <h1>Welcome to Acsell Happy Place</h1>
        <p> My name Acsell Heredia and I’m studying Digital Design at Borough of Manhattan Community college. I always been a creative person since a young age I like drawing and using my creativity to do something good. I always wanted to create art somehow but I just wanted to do it. </p>
        <p>Since high school I wanted to go to college for something I’m interested in and something that I would be happy to do everyday. Digital design is gonna give me the opportunity to do everything I want in that career field. Digital Design can be found everywhere at anytime and without realization you probably looking at a design rigth now. Digital design makes a person think deep because the meaning of an art piece can be hidden and hard to find.  </p>
